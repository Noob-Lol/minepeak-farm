# Minepeak auto farm
Automated coin farm on [Minepeak](https://dashboard.minepeakhosting.com/dashboard), speed is ~800 (1 click=30) per minute, per instance. 

Made on Python with Selenium WebDriver.

This script is made from [stozu-auto-farm](https://github.com/Noob-Lol/stozu-auto-farm) + [stozu-auto-farm-v2](https://github.com/Noob-Lol/stozu-auto-farm-v2), adapted to new site.

**Linkvertise farming is back, yay!**
## What is minepeak
Minepeak is a free 24/7 Minecraft hosting.

Max resources: 3 cores, 8gb RAM, 30gb storage, per server. 1 server max (currently).

If you have too many coins - giveaway it to someone, destroy economy. ðŸ˜†

To run unsupported servers (fabric, forge, etc) copy files from the hosting where it's supported. Or dm me and i will make it. ðŸ˜ƒ
